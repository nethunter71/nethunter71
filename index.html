  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Although a lot of people hear the word “hackers” and think we’re talking about
    “cybercriminals”, a hacker is not
    always a bad guy. A hacker is just a person who uses computer programming or technical skills to overcome a
    challenge or problem. As with most labels, there’s a good side and a bad side, and there are also people who fall
    somewhere in between.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">There are many different types of hackers. For example, a “white hat” hacker is an
    ethical computer security
    expert or programmer who works with organizations or ethical hacking groups to find cybersecurity vulnerabilities
    in order to fix them, not take advantage of them. You may have also heard of “hacktivists”, who use technology to
    spread social, political, ideological, or religious messages. Hackers can also be people who are involved in the
    software side of maker culture. These hackers use programming and electronics to create art, music, applications,
    or innovative solutions to challenges.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">If the word “hacker” brings to mind a cybercriminal who uses their programming expertise
    to break into corporate
    and private systems to steal data, you’re probably thinking of a “black hat” hacker. These are hackers who
    intentionally violate computer security for a variety of reasons, such as theft, fraud, corporate espionage, and
    even old-fashioned malice. (The terms “white hat” and “black hat” come from the Western movie genre in America
    because the heroes of those stories often wore white hats, while the villains wore black ones.) Additionally,
    there are also “gray hat” hackers whose goals are somewhere in between. Many of them are freelancers looking to
    make a profit by exposing vulnerabilities in an organization’s security structure, and offering to fix them for a
    fee.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size: 50px; color: tomato;">Hacking on Android phones</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">While most associate hacking with Windows computers, the Android operating system also
    offers an inviting target for hackers.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">A bit of history: Early hackers who obsessively explored low-tech methods for getting
    around the secure telecommunication networks (and expensive long-distance calls of their era) were originally
    called phreaks—a combination of the words phone and freaks. They were a defined subculture in the 1970s, and their
    activity was called phreaking.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Nowadays, phreakers have evolved out of the analog technology era and become hackers in
    the digital world of more than two billion mobile devices. Mobile phone hackers use a variety of methods to access
    an individual's mobile phone and intercept voicemails, phone calls, text messages, and even the phone's microphone
    and camera, all without that user's permission or even knowledge.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">“Cybercriminals could view your stored data on the phone, including identity and
    financial information.”</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Compared to iPhones, Android phones are much more fractured, whose open-source nature
    and inconsistencies in standards in terms of software development put the Androids at a greater risk of data
    corruption and data theft. And any number of bad things result from Android hacking.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Cybercriminals could view your stored data on the phone, including identity and
    financial information. Likewise,
    hackers can track your location, force your phone to text premium websites, or even spread their hack (with an
    embedded malicious link) to others among your contacts, who will click on it because it appears to come from you.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Of course, legitimate law enforcement might hack phones with a warrant to store copies
    of texts and emails, transcribe private conversations, or follow the suspect's movements. But black hat hackers
    could definitely do harm by accessing your bank account credentials, deleting data, or adding a host of malicious
    programs.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Phone hackers have the advantage of many computer hacking techniques, which are easy to
    adapt to Androids. Phishing, the crime of targeting individuals or members of entire organizations to lure them
    into revealing sensitive information through social engineering, is a tried and true method for criminals. In
    fact, because a phone displays a much smaller address bar compared to a PC, phishing on a mobile Internet browser
    probably makes it easier to counterfeit a seemingly trusted website without revealing the subtle tells (such as
    intentional misspellings) that you can see on a desktop browser. So you get a note from your bank asking you to
    log on to resolve an urgent problem, click on the conveniently provided link, enter your credentials in the form,
    and the hackers have youbr.<br>

    Trojanized apps downloaded from unsecured marketplaces are another crossover hacker threat to Androids. Major
    Android app stores (Google and Amazon) keep careful watch on the third-party apps; but embedded malware can get
    through either occasionally from the trusted sites, or more often from the sketchier ones. This is the way your
    phone ends up hosting adware, spyware, ransomware, or any other number of malware nasties.<br><br>

    “Bluehacking gains access to your phone when it shows up on an unprotected Bluetooth network.”<br><br>

    Other methods are even more sophisticated and don't require manipulating the user into clicking on a bad link.
    Bluehacking gains access to your phone when it shows up on an unprotected Bluetooth network. It's even possible to
    mimic a trusted network or cell phone tower to re-route text messages or log-on sessions. And if you leave your
    unlocked phone unattended in a public space, instead of just stealing it, a hacker can clone it by copying the SIM
    card, which is like handing over the keys to your castle.</p>
